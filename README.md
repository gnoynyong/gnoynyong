Yo, listen up, I'm a programmer, here to drop some rhymes <br><br>
Got skills that'll blow your mind, make you think it's summertime <br>
I code all day, and I code all night <br>
Building websites, apps, and software that's tight<br><br>

I'm always up on the latest trends, reading TechCrunch like it's my Bible<br>
Scouring GitHub for projects that are vital<br>
A quick learner, I'm always on the move<br>
Taking on new challenges, making magic happen like a groove<br>

My skills are sharp, my code is clean<br>
I debug like a machine, making everything pristine<br>
I'm the master of the programming scene<br>
And I won't stop until I reach my dream<br>

So if you need a programmer with some serious game<br>
Someone who can code circles around the rest, without any shame<br>
Look no further, 'cause I'm your man<br>
I'll make your software sing, and your website slam!<br>
