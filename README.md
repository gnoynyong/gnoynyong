Yo, listen up, I'm a programmer, here to drop some rhymes <br>
Got skills that'll blow your mind, make you think it's summertime
I code all day, and I code all night
Building websites, apps, and software that's tight

I'm always up on the latest trends, reading TechCrunch like it's my Bible
Scouring GitHub for projects that are vital
A quick learner, I'm always on the move
Taking on new challenges, making magic happen like a groove

My skills are sharp, my code is clean
I debug like a machine, making everything pristine
I'm the master of the programming scene
And I won't stop until I reach my dream

So if you need a programmer with some serious game
Someone who can code circles around the rest, without any shame
Look no further, 'cause I'm your man
I'll make your software sing, and your website slam!
